Literally all this mod does is remove those stupid mixels on a couple items. I'll hapilly remove another mixel if people let me know what sprites have them.

Current items fixed by Mixel Begone:

1. Luminite Ore
2. Hallowed Platemail
3. Crystal Serpent

Version 1.2 - Fixed the Crystal Serpent mixel on the bottom of it's tail.

Version 1.1 - Fixed the Hallowed Platemail mixel under the shoulder plate.

Version 1.0 - Fixed the Luminite mixel on the right side of the sprite.
